  In a federated scientific data management system, individual nodes serve as autonomous components that collectively form a distributed research infrastructure. **Institutional Storage Gateway Nodes** provide access to large-scale research repositories, exposing datasets while maintaining local security policies. **Personal Research Nodes** represent scientists' laptops or workstations that share specialized datasets, analysis tools, or computational resources directly from personal environments. **Compute Cluster Gateway Nodes** serve as entry points to high-performance computing resources, enabling remote access to parallel processing clusters or specialized facilities. Each node maintains its own security boundaries and governance while contributing to seamless cross-institutional resource and data sharing.
